            Our founder’s journey began in competitive gymnastics and dance,
            competing at both national and international levels. With a
            deep-rooted passion for understanding human performance, she was
            awarded a prestigious British Council Scholarship to pursue a
            Master’s in Sports and Exercise Science in the UK. This education,
            combined with her certifications as a 200-hour Ashtanga Yoga Teacher
            from Ashtanga Yoga Mysore (India), has given her a unique
            perspective on enhancing holistic well-being through exercise
            science, meditation, nutrition and recovery. With a passion for
            technology, she has also developed digital products tailored for
            athletes and health enthusiasts to enhance their training and
            optimize health.

          <p>
            With years of experience in multinational corporations, our founder
            understands the demands and pressures of the modern workplace. Her
            firsthand experience with stress and burnout drives her mission to
            create corporate wellness solutions that make a tangible difference.
            Her vision is to empower individuals to bring their best selves to
            work every day.
